# OpenGL Learning

This folder contains C and C++ code from my freshman year while learning OpenGL.

## Overview

It includes a simple, incomplete 2D/3D game engine developed during a C programming course, later rewritten in C++ for a freshman seminar project.

Key projects:

- **20201230-c-game-demo**: Initial C version of the game engine.
- **20210731-cpp-renderer**: C++ version used for the seminar project.

## Status

These projects are deprecated and not actively maintained. Some third-party libraries/assets were removed, affecting functionality. Compilation on modern systems may require updates.

Feel free to explore for learning purposes, but functionality is not guaranteed.

Reach out with any questions!
