# OpenGL Learning (Legacy)

This directory contains some ugly C and C++ code I wrote while learning OpenGL in my freshman year. 

To be specific, there is a simple and incomplete 2D & 3D game engine I created for my C programming course (see [20201230-c-game-demo](20201230-c-game-demo/), which was later rewritten in C++ (see [20210731-cpp-renderer](20201230-c-game-demo/) to finish my freshman seminar project.

Currently, these projects have been deprecated by me. I archived the source code here after removing some 3rd-party libraries and assets. Since I have not touched them for a long time, I cannot guarantee that they can be compiled and run successfully.
